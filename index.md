# Hush

## Description

Hush is an app that will put your device on silent mode either for a given amount of time, or when the device detects that it's in a certain location (such as a workplace). After the time is up, or the device leaves the location, the app will return the devices sound back to where it started. There will also be a setting to allow certain alerts to bypass the app if you are recieving an important notification. Hush adds another layer of customization to your phone, allowing it to automatically adapt to your personal routune. Don't miss another important call or message while keeping your phone on silent.
